# mailshine
A simple and lightweight library that cleans html email content for use in other environments like webpages.

Email clients will often populate emails with style and class tags in the HTML they send. In addition, email clients will quote the entire previous email chain with each reply. While all these techniques work for traditional email, they cause headaches for email integration into other apps.

This library solves this problem.
